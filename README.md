#Authentication and Authorization System with RBAC
A complete Node.js application for implementing Authentication and Authorization with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This project demonstrates user registration, login with JWT, and protected routes based on user roles and permissions.

#Features
Authentication: User registration with hashed passwords.
User login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).


Authorization with RBAC:
Define roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
Assign permissions (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) to roles.
Enforce role-based access control on APIs.


Protected Routes:
Role-specific access to resources based on permissions.



Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Middleware: Custom authentication and authorization logic

Installation Process
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/auth-rbac-system.git
cd auth-rbac-system

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rbac_example
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000

4. Run the Server

npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.


Register a User:

POST /api/auth/register
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123",
  "roles": ["Admin"]
}


Login to Get JWT Token:
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123"
}


Response:
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
}



Access a Protected Route: Use the JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE
Roles and Permissions
Role	Permissions
Admin	CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
Editor	CREATE, READ, UPDATE
